# Audio Steganography

We decided to implement a Least Significant Bit (LSB) audio steganography program for our final project. Steganography, the art of hiding information within other, seemingly innocent information, was something we all found interesting when taking this class. Completing the image processing assignment got us even more interested in the field, and we chose to write an audio version as well. Our program focused on lsb steganography. It analyzed the least significant bits - the last bit of each byte - in an audio file, compiling them all to create a hidden message. Although you can see these changes on a computer, to the human ear the audio sounds virtually the same, making this an extremely effective method of concealing the existence of messages. 
We were also fascinated by a spectrogram, altered to show a message, of an audio track which we were shown in class. We created spectrograms like this for our audio files, in order to see what the altered tracks look like, in addition to hearing what they sound like. 


**Audio Steganography**: the act of hiding secret messages in audio files

### Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion

* data is extracted from the audio file, and the bits of the message are hidden in the least significant bits of the audio file
* to extract the message, the least significant bits are extracted and the message is reconstructed

* Pros: One of the simplest methods to hide message, and LSB doesn't change the byte by much so it shouldn't be perceptible
* Cons: In an audio file, changing the LSB of every byte might generate noise that has a chance of being noticed by the human

### Modifications

*  **Increment mode** : Instead of changing the LSB of every byte, change the LSB of every other byte or every two or three bytes
*  **MSB mode** : Come up with a way of determining which bytes will get changed, for example if the byte's first two bits are 11

These modes decrease the noise generated by the changing of the LSB by alternating and spreading out the bytes that are altered

### Visual
* spectograms!
