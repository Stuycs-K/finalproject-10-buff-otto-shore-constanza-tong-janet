# Audio Steganography

**Audio Steganography**: the act of hiding secret messages in audio files

### Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion

* data is extracted from the audio file, and the bits of the message are hidden in the least significant bits of the audio file
* to extract the message, the least significant bits are extracted and the message is reconstructed

* Pros: One of the simplest methods to hide message, and LSB doesn't change the byte by much so it shouldn't be perceptible
* Cons: In an audio file, changing the LSB of every byte might generate noise that has a chance of being noticed by the human

### Modifications

*  **Increment mode** : Instead of changing the LSB of every byte, change the LSB of every other byte or every two or three bytes
*  **MSB mode** : Come up with a way of determining which bytes will get changed, for example if the byte's first two bits are 11

These modes decrease the noise generated by the changing of the LSB by alternating and spreading out the bytes that are altered

### Visual
* spectograms!
