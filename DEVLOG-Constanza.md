## Constanza Shore Coloni

### 2025-06-03
* still testing decode with encode
* research on how to hide image in a spectrogram using code not just outside software or tools
* got nowhere with the spctrogram so researched other methods of setagnography
* https://repository.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1305&context=other
* https://svenruppert.com/2024/04/17/audio-steganography-in-more-detail/
* helped Janet with adding modes to encode/decode in python (code transferred from java)

### 2025-06-02
* testing encode/decode by creating files to be used by decode, examining why it doesn't work 
* wrote encoded bytes to file
* spent time testing manually to double check where error in encoding and decoding was coming from, found encode fully functiong!

### Out for eye surgery from 2025-05-29 to 2025-05-1 :(

### 2025-05-27
* fully tested encode
* researching different audio steganography
* started trying different LSB encode, only replacing LSB of every third byte to eliminate noise

### 2025-05-23
* debugged encode, fully functioning now
* made makefile
* did some more reserach for ideas to expand project, looking at different methods that we could implement

### 2025-05-22
* working on encode method
* finished writing and spent time debugging

### 2025-05-21
* Started working on encode method for LSB

### 2025-05-20
* Researched LSB insertion method
* Planned out methods, worked on reading in file of bits (from audio) to encode

### 2025-05-19
* Discussed project and class and decided to switch from morse code to LSB audio steganography
* split up work
* Created file to start working on encode

### 2025-05-16 - Decided on Audio Steganography
* Researched types of audio steganography to do for project, decided on morse code
* Took a look at morse code decrypters
* Researched how we could read in an audio
