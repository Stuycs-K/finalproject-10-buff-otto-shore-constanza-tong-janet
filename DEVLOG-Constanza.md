### 2025-06-03
* testing decode with encode
* research on how to hide image in a spectrogram using code not just outside software or tools
* got nowhere with the spctrogram so researched other methods of setagnography

### 2025-06-02
* testing encode
* wrote encoded bytes to file

### 2025-05-27
* fully tested encode
* researching different audio steganography
* started different LSB encode, only replacing LSB of every third byte

### 2025-05-23
* debugged encode, fully functioning now
* made makefile
* did some more reserach for ideas to expand project

### 2025-05-22
* working on encode method
* spent time debugging

### 2025-05-21
* Started working on encoding with LSB

### 2025-05-20
* Planned out methods, worked on reading in file of bits (from audio) to encode

### 2025-05-19 - Brief description
* Discussed project and class and decided to switch from morse code to LSB audio steganography
* split up work
* Created file to start working on encode

### 2025-05-16 - Decided on Audio Steganography
* Researched types of audio steganography to do for project, decided on morse code
* Took a look at morse code decrypters
* Researched how we could read in an audio
