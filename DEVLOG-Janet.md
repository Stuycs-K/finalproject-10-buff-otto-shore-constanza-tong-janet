### Sick from 2025-05-26 to 2025-05-29 :( - No Progress

### 2025-05-30 - Testing & Debugging
- Spent the period testing the byte output of audio.py for decode.java so Otto and Constanza could test their work 

### 2025-06-02 - Bits to Audio 
- Used shutil to create copy of audio file for modification (10 minutes)
- Converted encoded bytes back to the audio file (20 minutes) 
- Discussed further action items (5 minutes)

### 2025-06-03 - Spectrograms from Audio 
- Wrote function for visualizing wav files in both audio waves and spectrograms (10 minutes)

https://khareanu1612.medium.com/audio-signal-processing-with-spectrograms-and-librosa-b66a0a6bc5cc 
- Looked into the Librosa library for spectrograms (10 minutes)
- Reviewed how to convert audio into a spectrogram using matplot: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-a-spectrogram-using-python-and-matplotlib/ (10 minutes)
- Found a video on hiding wav files inside images instead! Pretty cool. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om-HJU4pwzg&ab_channel=FrancescoPiscani (5 minutes)

- Redid encode and decode in python (45 minutes)
